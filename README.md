# Team Hackathon Project
Concept: Use AI to simplify and improve the hiring process. 

Finding a good fit for a team could be difficult at times, especially since you're judging the applicant based on a list of bullet points. Our idea aims to help find someone that would suit your workplace. Résumés and cover letters would be analyzed for qualifications including relevant experience and skills. Additionally, their writing would be analyzed for the Big Five personality traits and candidates would be filtered out based on the hiring manager's specifications. The filtering of traits leaves applicants that display a personality that is the most similar to a desired employee.
